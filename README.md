# Hexlet Introduction to OOP in JS

My motivation to take the course was to get a deeper understanding of OOP & getting more coding practice.

JS is a multi-paradigm programming language with support for object-oriented programming.
This course introduces you to the basic concepts and syntactic constructions inherent in OOP. 
Encapsulation and data hiding are considered. 
The behavior of this is analyzed, prototypes and exceptions are studied.
